Update: When I tried to submit to the official jQuery Plugin list, I found that my original name (table2CSV) had already been taken, so I have changed every occurrence of 'table2CSV' to 'TableCSVExport'

This plugin converts any set of columns of a HTML table to a CSV file that can then be viewed in a popup window, as a data string, or downloaded as a file.

I had a need for such a utility at my day job (at LectureTools Inc.) and searching netted me only one interesting possibility - the initial plugin that I have built upon. It appears that development on this stopped around June 2009, so I decided to 'fork' it and enhance it. You can find my project here, on my Github account; It has the plugin and a HTML test page.

Dependencies:

This plugin was developed using jQuery 1.6.2 and is not tested with other versions.

Usage:

Include script file however you need to for your particular project.

HTML:[code]<script src='jquery.TableCSVExport.js'></script>[/code]
cakePHP 1.2: [code]echo $javascript->link("jquery.TableCSVExport.js");[/code]

cakePHP 1.3: [code]echo $html->script('jquery.TableCSVExport.js');[/code]

Then, simply execute the javascript line [code]jQuery('#table-id').TableCSVExport();[/code] to use the plugin with the default options.

Options:

separator (Default: ',')
The character that separates entries in the resulting CSV file.
 

delivery (Default: 'popup')

The manner in which to return the CSV data file. Options are:

'popup' - opens a new window and displays the CSV data in a box where it can be copied from.
'value' - returns the CSV data as a single long string
'download' - triggers a download of a file containing the CSV data
 

header (Default: [])

An array containing strings of the column headers

Example: [code] jQuery('#table-id').TableCSVExport({header:['Name','Mon','Tue','Wed','Thr','Fri']}) [/code]


columns (Default: [])

An array containing strings consisting of the headers for the columns to export. This MUST be a subset of the array passed to the header option.

Example: [code] jQuery('#table-id').TableCSVExport({header:['Name','Mon','Tue','Wed','Thr','Fri'], columns:['Name','Mon']}) [/code]

This will export only the 'Name' and 'Mon' columns as CSV data.

-- WARNING --

When using the columns option to only export certain columns, you must also set the header array and the columns array must be a subset of the header array.


emptyValue (Default: '')

Column default value if the column is empty.


showHiddenRows (Default: false)

if it's true, will export rows with display: 'none'.


rowFilter (Default: '')

You can add jquery selector filter, to filter table rows.

Ex: rowFilter: '.myClass'

filename (Default: 'download.csv')

Choose what the downloaded filename will be when using the 'download' delivery. Currently only reliable in Chrome.

Example usage on a download button:
$('#download-btn').click(function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    $('#my-table').TableCSVExport({
        delivery: 'download',
        filename: 'device-usage.csv'
    });
});


Important Notes:
 
1. The javascript .trim() function is called on each table datum, so be aware that beginning or terminating whitespace will be lost.
